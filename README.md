# Solon High School Spanish Website (Name TBD)

Hi, I'm Sully. This is one of my personal projects that I've done for my
High School after graduating. The purpose of it is to provide a way for
student pen pals in world languages classes to send short form videos back
and forth to each other with teacher moderation.

## Tech Stack

The frontend of this application is made with [React.JS](https://react.dev/)
(See [/frontend/src](./frontend/src/))

## TODO
- [ ] Add screenshots to README
- [ ] Elaborate on the features of the app further in development
- [ ] Make a section for the backend in the README as well as the frontend
- [ ] Port to AWS?
